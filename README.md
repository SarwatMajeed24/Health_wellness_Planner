Health & Wellness Planner Agent
This Streamlit-based and CLI-based AI-powered health and wellness planner uses the Gemini 2.0 Flash API to provide personalized or general health guidance. Users first enter a query, then choose between personalized (requires name, age, height, weight) or general responses to receive tailored fitness and dietary plans, schedule tasks, track progress, and access specialized advice for nutrition or injury concerns.
